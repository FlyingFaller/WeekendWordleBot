WeekendWordleBot is a work-in-progress bot to """optimally""" solve the NYT Wordle game I decided to make for fun one (three) weekened. It only has knowledge of the 14855 valid guess words (kinda), not the much small solution set (which doesn't exist publically anymore). It's based in Shannon entropy/information theory and there are many explinations out there for similar bots see the excellent videos by 3b1b.
